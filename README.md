# VaxBot
A simple discord bot that provides UK and Canada vaccination data when using !vacced

This was made quick and dirty, and the code is not a representation of my programming ability.

## Setup
To use this bot you need a [Bot Token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/). You will also need to add it to any servers you wish to use it with, it only needs message reading and sending permission.

The environment variable DISCORD_TOKEN needs to be set to the bot token. After this you can run the executable and it will connect to Discord and any servers the bot has been added to. You can check if the bot works by using !vacced or !version.
